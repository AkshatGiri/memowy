# Human Memory

## Sensory Memory ( 1-2 seconds, buffer of current incoming inputs )

## Working Memory ( short term memory )

This is your brain's mental workspace. It can hold about 7±2 pieces of information for roughly 20-30 seconds. Working memory doesn't just store information - it actively manipulates it.

## Long Term Memory

This is your brain's permanent storage system, with virtually unlimited capacity. It's divided into two main types:

Declarative (Explicit) Memory:

- Episodic memory: Personal experiences and events ("I had pizza for dinner yesterday")
- Semantic memory: General knowledge and facts ("Paris is the capital of France")

Non-declarative (Implicit) Memory:

- Procedural memory: Skills and procedures (riding a bike, typing)
- Priming: Unconscious memory effects that influence behavior
- Classical conditioning: Learned associations between stimuli

## Data Encoding ( TODO )

## Storage and Indexing ( TODO )

## Retrieval

This is what I’m most interested in right now.

Accessing stored information when needed. This can happen through:

- Recognition: Identifying previously encountered information
- Recall: Actively bringing information to mind without cues
- Reconstruction: Piecing together memories from available information

### Pattern Completion

Your brain uses a process called "pattern completion" where you only need part of a memory to activate the whole thing.

### Parallel Processing

Unlike computers that typically search sequentially, your brain processes information in parallel across millions of neurons simultaneously. When you try to remember something, multiple neural networks activate at once, racing to find the relevant information. The fastest path wins, which is why some memories seem to pop up instantly.

### Priming and Spreading Activation

When one memory or concept is activated, it automatically "primes" related memories, making them easier to access. This creates a spreading network of activation:

- Think "dog" and your brain preemptively activates related concepts like "pet," "fur," "bark"
- This preactivation means related memories are already "warmed up" and ready to be retrieved
- The process happens unconsciously and makes retrieval feel instantaneous

Okay so this must mean that there is a retrieval scoring system. First we start retrieving information and selectively discard information that's not necessary?

The brain does employ what cognitive scientists call "retrieval competition" and "inhibitory control" during memory search.

Memory Competition Process:

1. When you try to retrieve information, multiple competing memories are initially activated
2. Your brain assigns different "activation strengths" to these memories based on:
   - Relevance to your current goal
   - How recently you've accessed them
   - How strongly they're connected to your retrieval cues
   - Emotional significance
   - Frequency of past use

Inhibitory Mechanisms:
Your brain actively suppresses irrelevant competing memories through a process called "retrieval-induced forgetting." For example, if you're trying to remember where you parked your car today:

- All recent parking memories might initially activate
- Your brain suppresses memories of parking from previous days
- This helps focus on the most relevant information
  The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role here - it acts like a filter, helping to:
- Resolve competition between memories
- Suppress irrelevant or intrusive memories
- Focus attention on the most pertinent information
- Monitor the accuracy of retrieved memories

This is why memory retrieval is actually a reconstructive process rather than simply pulling up a complete file. Your brain is constantly evaluating and filtering information based on your current needs and context. It's also why sometimes you might experience:

- The "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon (when competing memories are partially activated)
- False memories (when reconstruction goes awry)
- Improved recall when given additional context (which helps narrow down the competition)
  This scoring and filtering system makes memory retrieval more efficient but can also lead to interesting phenomena like forgetting related information temporarily while focusing on retrieving specific details.
